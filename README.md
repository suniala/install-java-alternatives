# install-java-alternatives

A convenience script for when you want to tell update-alternatives to configure all the Java
alternatives to point at the binaries at your manually installed JDK.

## Disclaimer

Works for me!

## Usage Example
```
sudo ./install-java-alternatives.sh /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle-jdk/bin
```
